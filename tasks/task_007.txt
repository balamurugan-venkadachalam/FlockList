# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Notification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the notification system for alerting users about new tasks, upcoming deadlines, and task completions.
# Details:
Implement the Notification data model in MongoDB as specified in the PRD. Create Notification API endpoints (/api/notifications, etc.). Develop in-app notification center UI. Implement notification generation for key events (new task, task completion, upcoming deadline). Integrate with SendGrid or similar service for email notifications. Create notification preference settings for users. Implement notification read/unread status tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test notification generation for various events. Verify notification display in the UI. Test email notification delivery. Validate notification preference settings. Ensure notification read/unread status updates correctly. Test notification clearing and bulk actions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Notification Data Model in MongoDB [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the Notification schema in MongoDB to store notification data according to the PRD specifications.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a Notification schema with fields for: id, userId, type (task_created, deadline_approaching, task_completed), content, relatedEntityId (taskId), isRead, createdAt, and expiresAt.
2. Add appropriate indexes for efficient querying (userId, isRead, createdAt).
3. Implement validation rules for the schema fields.
4. Create model methods for common operations (markAsRead, deleteNotification).
5. Write unit tests to verify schema validation and model methods.
6. Document the schema design and API for other developers.

## 2. Implement Notification API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create RESTful API endpoints for managing notifications, including retrieving, marking as read, and deleting notifications.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create the following API endpoints:
   - GET /api/notifications - List all notifications for the current user with pagination
   - GET /api/notifications/unread - Get count of unread notifications
   - PUT /api/notifications/:id/read - Mark a notification as read
   - PUT /api/notifications/read-all - Mark all notifications as read
   - DELETE /api/notifications/:id - Delete a notification
2. Implement proper authentication middleware to ensure users can only access their own notifications.
3. Add request validation using a library like Joi or express-validator.
4. Implement pagination for notification listing with limit and offset parameters.
5. Write integration tests for each endpoint using Jest or similar testing framework.
6. Document the API endpoints using Swagger or similar tool.

## 3. Develop In-App Notification Center UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create the user interface components for displaying and interacting with notifications within the application.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a NotificationCenter component that displays a notification icon with an unread count badge in the app header.
2. Implement a dropdown panel that shows recent notifications when clicked.
3. Design notification list items with different styling based on notification type and read status.
4. Add actions for marking notifications as read when clicked and clearing all notifications.
5. Implement infinite scroll or pagination for loading more notifications.
6. Add animations for new notifications appearing.
7. Create skeleton loaders for notification items during loading states.
8. Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
9. Write unit tests for the notification components using React Testing Library or similar.
10. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

## 4. Implement Notification Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the business logic for generating notifications based on key events in the application.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a NotificationService class to handle notification generation.
2. Implement event listeners for key application events:
   - Task creation: Generate notification for assigned users
   - Task completion: Notify task creator and relevant stakeholders
   - Upcoming deadlines: Create notifications for tasks due within 24 hours and 3 days
3. Design a queuing system for processing notifications asynchronously using a library like Bull or similar.
4. Implement notification deduplication logic to prevent notification spam.
5. Add configurable throttling for notification frequency.
6. Create unit tests for the notification generation logic, mocking the event triggers.
7. Implement logging for notification generation for debugging purposes.

## 5. Integrate Email Notification Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Integrate with SendGrid or similar email service to send email notifications for important events.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Set up SendGrid (or alternative) account and obtain API keys.
2. Create an EmailService class to handle email sending with appropriate error handling and retries.
3. Design email templates for different notification types (new task, deadline reminder, task completion).
4. Implement logic to determine which notifications should trigger emails based on user preferences.
5. Create a queue for processing email notifications to handle high volume scenarios.
6. Add rate limiting to prevent email flooding.
7. Implement email tracking to record when emails are sent, opened, and clicked.
8. Set up email delivery failure handling and reporting.
9. Create unit tests with mocked SendGrid API responses.
10. Document the email integration for other developers.

## 6. Implement User Notification Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Create settings that allow users to configure which notifications they receive and how they receive them.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Extend the User model with notification preference fields:
   - In-app notification settings (task_created, deadline_approaching, task_completed)
   - Email notification settings (same categories)
   - Notification frequency settings (immediate, daily digest, weekly digest)
2. Create API endpoints for updating notification preferences:
   - GET /api/users/notification-preferences
   - PUT /api/users/notification-preferences
3. Develop a NotificationPreferences UI component with toggles for different notification types and channels.
4. Modify the notification generation logic to respect user preferences.
5. Implement a notification digest system for users who prefer batched notifications.
6. Add a preview feature to show examples of different notification types.
7. Create unit and integration tests for the preference system.
8. Ensure all notification generation respects the user's current preferences.

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the authentication system with user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
# Details:
Implement the User data model in MongoDB as specified in the PRD. Create authentication API endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/me). Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens. Use bcrypt for secure password hashing. Set up role-based access control (parent, child). Create frontend authentication forms and protected routes. Implement token storage and refresh mechanism in the frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with valid and invalid data. Verify login functionality and JWT token generation. Test token refresh mechanism. Validate role-based access restrictions. Ensure password reset functionality works correctly. Test authentication persistence across page reloads.

6. Set up secure cookie handling for tokens
7. Create token blacklisting mechanism for logout
8. Test token generation, validation, and refresh flows
9. Implement proper error handling for token expiration and invalid tokens

## 5. Implement Role-Based Access Control [completed]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Set up role-based permissions system to control access based on user roles (parent, child).
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create middleware for role-based route protection
2. Define permission constants for different user roles
3. Implement role checking in protected routes
4. Create utility functions to verify permissions for specific actions
5. Add role information to JWT payload
6. Set up route-specific permission checks
7. Test access control by attempting operations with different user roles
8. Document the permission system for other developers

## 6. Create Frontend Authentication Forms and Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop the frontend components for user registration, login, and implement protected route navigation.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create registration form component with validation
2. Implement login form with error handling
3. Develop form submission handlers to connect with API endpoints
4. Create protected route component/wrapper
5. Implement authentication context/provider to manage auth state

8. Implement logout functionality in the UI
9. Test form validation and submission
10. Ensure responsive design for all authentication forms

## 7. Implement Frontend Token Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.6
### Description: Set up client-side token storage, automatic token refresh, and authentication state management.
### Details:
Implementation details:

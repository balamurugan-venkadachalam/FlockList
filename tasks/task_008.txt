# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Advanced Task Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the task management system with advanced features like recurring tasks, priorities, and attachments.
# Details:
Implement recurring task functionality with customizable patterns. Develop task priority system (high, medium, low) with visual indicators. Create task commenting system for family communication. Implement file attachment capability for tasks (using AWS S3 or similar). Develop task history tracking to show changes and updates. Enhance filtering and sorting options for tasks. Implement task dependency relationships if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test recurring task creation with various patterns. Verify task priority assignment and display. Test commenting functionality on tasks. Validate file upload and attachment to tasks. Ensure task history correctly tracks changes. Test enhanced filtering and sorting options.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Task Priority System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a priority system for tasks with high, medium, and low levels, including database schema updates, UI components, and visual indicators.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update the task database schema to include a 'priority' field (enum with values: 'high', 'medium', 'low', default to 'medium')
2. Create UI components for priority selection in task creation/edit forms
3. Implement visual indicators for different priorities (e.g., color coding: red for high, yellow for medium, green for low)
4. Add priority information to task list views and detail views
5. Update task API endpoints to handle priority data
6. Implement priority-based sorting functionality

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for priority-related database operations
- UI tests for priority selection and display
- Integration tests for priority filtering and sorting

## 2. Implement Recurring Task Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a system for recurring tasks with customizable patterns like daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the task schema to include recurrence fields (frequency type, interval, end date/count)
2. Design and implement UI for setting up recurring task patterns
3. Create a background job/scheduler to generate new task instances based on recurrence patterns
4. Implement logic to handle task completion vs. recurrence pattern (mark instance complete while maintaining pattern)
5. Add ability to edit recurrence patterns or cancel future occurrences
6. Implement visual indicators for recurring tasks

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for recurrence pattern logic
- Integration tests for task generation
- Time-based tests to verify correct scheduling
- UI tests for recurrence setup and management

## 3. Implement Task Commenting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a commenting system for tasks to enable family communication and discussion about specific tasks.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a comments database schema with relationships to tasks and users
2. Implement API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting comments
3. Design and implement UI components for displaying comments in task details view
4. Add comment creation form with text input and submission
5. Implement real-time or polling updates for new comments
6. Add notification system for new comments on tasks

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for comment CRUD operations
- Integration tests for comment-task relationships
- UI tests for comment display and creation
- Performance tests for comment loading with large numbers of comments

## 4. Implement File Attachment Capability [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create functionality to attach files to tasks using AWS S3 or similar cloud storage.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up AWS S3 bucket or similar cloud storage solution
2. Create database schema for file attachments (filename, file type, size, S3 URL, task relationship)
3. Implement secure file upload functionality with proper authentication
4. Create API endpoints for uploading, downloading, and deleting attachments
5. Implement UI components for file upload, display, and management
6. Add file type validation and size limitations
7. Implement progress indicators for file uploads

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for file metadata handling
- Integration tests with mock S3 service
- UI tests for upload and download functionality
- Security tests for access control to attachments

## 5. Implement Task History Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Develop a system to track and display the history of changes and updates made to tasks.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a task history database schema to store change records
2. Implement logic to capture changes to task properties (status, priority, due date, etc.)
3. Record user information and timestamps with each change
4. Design and implement UI to display task history in chronological order
5. Add filtering options for history entries by change type
6. Implement condensed vs. detailed history views

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for history record creation
- Integration tests for change tracking across task operations
- UI tests for history display
- Performance tests with large history datasets

## 6. Enhance Filtering and Sorting Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Expand the task filtering and sorting capabilities to include the new advanced features.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update existing filter system to include new properties (priority, recurrence, has attachments, has comments)
2. Implement advanced search functionality across task properties and comments
3. Create UI components for advanced filtering options
4. Add sorting options by priority, comment count, attachment count, and last update
5. Implement filter presets/saved filters functionality
6. Add visual indicators for active filters

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for filter and sort logic
- Integration tests for combined filters
- UI tests for filter controls
- Performance tests with large datasets and complex filters

## 7. Implement Task Dependency Relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Create a system to establish and manage dependencies between tasks, where one task must be completed before another can start.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update task schema to include dependency relationships (many-to-many)
2. Implement API endpoints for creating and managing task dependencies
3. Create UI for adding, viewing, and removing dependencies between tasks
4. Implement validation to prevent circular dependencies
5. Add visual indicators for dependent tasks and blockers
6. Update task status logic to consider dependencies (can't start if blockers exist)
7. Implement dependency chain visualization

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for dependency relationship management
- Integration tests for dependency validation
- UI tests for dependency creation and visualization
- Logic tests for circular dependency prevention

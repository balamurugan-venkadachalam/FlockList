# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Base Architecture
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend structure. Set up MongoDB connection and basic project configuration.
# Details:
Create a new GitHub repository. Initialize frontend with React.js 18+ using Create React App or Vite. Set up backend with Node.js 18+ and Express 4+. Configure MongoDB 5+ connection using Mongoose. Set up Docker configuration for development. Implement basic folder structure following best practices. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful project initialization by running the application locally. Test MongoDB connection. Ensure Docker containers build and run correctly. Validate that CI/CD pipeline executes successfully on push.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub Repository and Project Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the GitHub repository and establish the basic project structure for a full-stack application
### Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository with an appropriate name
2. Initialize with README.md, .gitignore (Node.js template), and LICENSE files
3. Create the root project structure with folders: `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/docs`
4. Add a root package.json for workspace management
5. Create initial documentation explaining the project architecture
6. Test by cloning the repository and verifying the structure is intact

## 2. Setup React.js Frontend Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize and configure the React.js frontend application with necessary dependencies and configuration
### Details:
1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory
2. Initialize React application using Vite with TypeScript template
3. Configure folder structure: `/src/components`, `/src/pages`, `/src/hooks`, `/src/utils`, `/src/assets`
4. Set up ESLint and Prettier configuration for React
5. Add `.env` file with example environment variables
6. Configure package.json scripts for development, building, and testing
7. Test by running the development server and verifying the app loads correctly

## 3. Setup Node.js/Express Backend Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize and configure the Node.js/Express backend with appropriate folder structure and basic endpoints
### Details:
1. Navigate to the `/backend` directory
2. Initialize Node.js project with `npm init`
3. Install Express.js, cors, dotenv, and other essential dependencies
4. Create folder structure: `/src/controllers`, `/src/models`, `/src/routes`, `/src/middleware`, `/src/config`, `/src/utils`
5. Implement basic server.js file with Express configuration
6. Set up a health check endpoint (`GET /api/health`)
7. Configure ESLint and Prettier for Node.js
8. Test by starting the server and verifying the health endpoint responds correctly

## 4. Configure MongoDB Connection with Mongoose [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose and implement database configuration
### Details:
1. Install Mongoose in the backend
2. Create database configuration in `/backend/src/config/db.js`
3. Implement connection function with error handling and reconnection logic
4. Add MongoDB connection string to `.env` file
5. Create a sample schema and model in `/backend/src/models`
6. Update server.js to connect to MongoDB on startup
7. Test by verifying successful database connection in logs and ability to perform basic operations on the sample model

## 5. Implement Docker Configuration for Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create Docker and Docker Compose configuration for local development environment
### Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for frontend in `/frontend/Dockerfile`
2. Create Dockerfile for backend in `/backend/Dockerfile`
3. Create docker-compose.yml in the root directory
4. Configure services for frontend, backend, and MongoDB
5. Set up volume mappings for hot reloading
6. Configure environment variables and networking between containers
7. Add docker-related entries to .gitignore
8. Test by running `docker-compose up` and verifying all services start correctly and can communicate with each other

## 6. Set up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5
### Description: Implement continuous integration and deployment workflow using GitHub Actions
### Details:
1. Create `.github/workflows` directory in the repository
2. Implement `ci.yml` workflow for continuous integration
3. Configure steps for linting, testing, and building both frontend and backend
4. Implement caching for node_modules to speed up workflow
5. Add status badges to README.md
6. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
7. Test by pushing changes and verifying the workflow runs successfully
8. Optionally, add a deployment workflow for staging/production environments

# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core task creation, assignment, and management functionality that forms the foundation of the application.
# Details:
Implement the Task data model in MongoDB as specified in the PRD. Create Task API endpoints (/api/tasks, /api/tasks/:id, etc.). Develop task creation interface with fields for title, description, due date, and assignees. Implement task assignment to family members. Create task listing and basic filtering functionality. Develop task completion marking functionality. Implement basic task categorization (homework, chores, activities).

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation with various inputs. Verify task assignment to multiple family members. Test task listing and filtering by different criteria. Validate task completion marking functionality. Ensure task categories are correctly applied and filtered.

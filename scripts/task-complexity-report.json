      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Base Architecture",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project repository and architecture setup into distinct technical phases covering repository creation, frontend setup, backend setup, database configuration, Docker setup, and CI/CD pipeline implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components (frontend, backend, database, Docker, CI/CD) that require different expertise. Each component has its own configuration needs and potential issues, making it moderately complex with clear separation points for subtasks."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into logical components covering data modeling, backend API endpoints, security mechanisms, frontend forms, and state management for authentication.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is security-critical with multiple interconnected parts (database models, API endpoints, JWT handling, frontend integration). The complexity is high due to security requirements, token management, and the need for careful testing of each component."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Family Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the family management system into components covering data modeling, API development, invitation system, and frontend interfaces for family creation and management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend and frontend work with relationship management between users. The invitation system adds complexity, requiring email integration and state management. The UI components need careful design for usability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Task Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the core task management functionality into components covering data modeling, API development, task creation interfaces, assignment mechanisms, listing views, and completion functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This is a central feature of the application with complex data relationships and UI interactions. It requires careful modeling of task data, multiple API endpoints, and several UI components that must work together seamlessly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Task Dashboard and UI Components",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard development into components covering layout design, task visualization cards, filtering mechanisms, user-specific views, and accessibility implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily frontend-focused with moderate complexity. It requires design skills and attention to UI/UX details, but has fewer technical dependencies than backend tasks. The component-based nature makes it naturally divisible."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Calendar View",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the calendar implementation into components covering the base calendar widget, task display integration, interaction handling, filtering capabilities, and responsive design adaptations.",
      "reasoning": "Calendar implementations are moderately complex due to date handling, visual representation challenges, and interaction patterns. Integration with the task system adds complexity, as does ensuring responsive behavior across devices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Notification System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the notification system into components covering data modeling, API endpoints, notification generation logic, UI implementation, email integration, and user preference management.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans both backend and frontend with external service integration (email). It requires event-based logic to generate notifications and careful UI design to present them effectively without overwhelming users."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Task Features",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the advanced task features into distinct components covering recurring task patterns, priority system, commenting functionality, file attachment capabilities, history tracking, and enhanced filtering options.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the variety of advanced features that each have their own technical challenges. Recurring tasks require complex date logic, attachments need external storage integration, and history tracking requires careful data design."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Enhanced Calendar Features",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhanced calendar features into components covering drag-and-drop implementation, conflict detection algorithms, visual indicators, calendar export functionality, customization options, and sharing capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "Advanced calendar features involve complex UI interactions (drag-and-drop) and sophisticated logic (conflict detection). Integration with external calendar systems adds complexity, as does implementing intuitive visual indicators for various states."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design and Final Polishing",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the responsive design and polishing work into components covering device-specific optimizations, performance improvements, loading states and error handling, animations and transitions, cross-browser testing, and final quality assurance.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive review and refinement across the entire application. While each individual change might be small, the breadth of work and the need for careful testing across devices and browsers creates moderate complexity."
